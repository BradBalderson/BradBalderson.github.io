Hi I'm Brad. I'm a PhD student in the Boden lab at the University of Queensland. I work on creating novel computational methods to extract useful biological
information from high-throughput assays such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq. I am mostly interested in the combinatoric effect of gene expression and its influence on cell type and cell differentiation.
