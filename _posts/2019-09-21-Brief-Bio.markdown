Hi, I'm Brad. 

I'm a PhD student in the Boden lab at the University of Queensland. 
I work on creating novel computational methods to extract biological
insights from high-throughput assays such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq. 
My main interest in the combinatoric effect of gene expression and its 
influence on cell type and cell differentiation. This naturally includes
interaction effects between gene expression combinatorics and chromatin accessibility.
