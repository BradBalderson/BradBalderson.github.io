Hi, I'm Brad. 

I'm a PhD student at the University of Queensland. 
I work on computational methods to extract biological
insights from high-throughput assays such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq. 
My main interest is the combinatoric effect of gene expression and its 
influence on cell type and cell differentiation. This naturally includes
the interaction effect between gene expression combinatorics and chromatin accessibility.
