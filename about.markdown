Hi, I'm Brad.

I'm a PhD student at the University of Queensland.
I work on computational methods to extract biological
insights from high-throughput assays such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq.
My main interest is the combinatoric effect of gene expression and its
influence on cell type and cell differentiation. This includes
the interaction effect between gene expression combinatorics and chromatin accessibility.
