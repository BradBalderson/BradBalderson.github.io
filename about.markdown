Hi, I'm Brad.

I'm a PhD student at the University of Queensland.
I work on computational methods to extract biological
insights from high-throughput assays such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq.
My main interest is the combinatorial effect of gene expression and its
influence on cell type and cell differentiation. This includes
the interaction effect between gene expression combinatorics and chromatin accessibility.

Aside from research, I love reading, writing, and programming. The main point
of this blog is to share great books, some articles, and also some pseudo-code.

I think that all of us, whether we are aware of it or not, act in the world following a 
set of rules. This set of rules govern our decision making and ultimately what we achieve.
The main type of article I'd like to share here is pseudo-code for the rules that I use
when approaching Bioinformatics and other various related activities. I'd also like to share 
articles regarding how to write good quality code and set up reproducible and shareable projects.

Happy reading!
